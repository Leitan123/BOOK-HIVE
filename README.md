# 📚 BOOK-HIVE – Library Management System

## About the Project

**BOOK-HIVE** is a modern, web-based Library Management System developed using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project aims to simplify and streamline core library operations such as **book borrowing, returns, book management, and user administration**.

BOOK-HIVE provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed for both **library users** and **administrators**, ensuring seamless interactions and smooth transaction flow. Users can browse and borrow books, while admins can add new titles, verify borrow requests, manage inventory, and monitor user activities in real-time.

This system enhances operational efficiency by automating key library processes and maintaining a well-organized database of books and transactions. Whether it's borrowing a book or managing a library's entire collection, BOOK-HIVE brings a reliable and scalable solution to digital library management.
