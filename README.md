ðŸ“š BOOK-HIVE â€“ Library Management System

About the Project

BOOK-HIVE is a modern, web-based Library Management System developed using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project aims to simplify and streamline core library operations such as book borrowing, returns, book management, and user administration.

BOOK-HIVE provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed for both library users and administrators, ensuring seamless interactions and smooth transaction flow. Users can browse and borrow books, while admins can add new titles, verify borrow requests, manage inventory, and monitor user activities in real-time.

This system enhances operational efficiency by automating key library processes and maintaining a well-organized database of books and transactions. Whether it's borrowing a book or managing a library's entire collection, BOOK-HIVE brings a reliable and scalable solution to digital library management.
